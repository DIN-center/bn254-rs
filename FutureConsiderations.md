   - Add IP allowlisting for operator connections

2. **Key Management Hardening**
   - Implement key usage limits and automatic rotation triggers
   - Add entropy monitoring during key generation
   - Implement secure key deletion procedures with verification
   - Add hardware security module (HSM) support for root keys
   - Implement key backup procedures with geographical distribution
   - Add version control for key metadata

3. **Secure Enclave Enhancement**
   - Regular security patches and updates policy
   - Implement secure boot and attestation
   - Add runtime integrity monitoring
   - Implement memory encryption for all key material
   - Add secure audit logging for all key operations
   - Implement secure error handling to prevent information leakage

4. **Monitoring and Incident Response**
   - Add real-time alerting for suspicious activities
   - Implement automated response procedures for potential breaches
   - Add comprehensive audit logging with tamper detection
   - Create incident response playbooks
   - Implement automated backup verification
   - Add regular security scanning and penetration testing procedures

5. **Compliance and Standards**
   - Align with NIST SP 800-57 key management guidelines
   - Implement FIPS 140-3 compliance where applicable
   - Add support for regulatory reporting requirements
   - Create key ceremony procedures and documentation
   - Implement secure key destruction procedures meeting regulatory requirements

## Glossary

### Security Components and Protocols

- **HSM (Hardware Security Module)**
  - A physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys
  - Provides tamper-evident, tamper-resistant protection for cryptographic operations
  - Typically FIPS 140-2/3 certified for high-security environments
  - Used for storing root keys and performing critical cryptographic operations

- **mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security)**
  - Enhanced version of TLS where both client and server authenticate each other
  - Both parties present digital certificates to prove their identity
  - Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and unauthorized service access
  - Essential for secure service-to-service communication

- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
  - Security tool that filters and monitors HTTP/HTTPS traffic
  - Protects web applications from common attacks like SQL injection, XSS
  - Can implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
  - Provides real-time security monitoring and alerting

### Other Technical Terms

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
  - Security model that restricts system access based on roles
  - Enables granular permission management
  - Simplifies access management for large organizations

- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**
  - Attack that attempts to overwhelm services with traffic
  - Mitigated through rate limiting and WAF protection

- **FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards)**
  - U.S. government security standards for cryptographic modules
  - FIPS 140-3 is the current standard for cryptographic security

- **MPC (Multi-Party Computation)**
  - Cryptographic technique allowing multiple parties to compute together
  - Enables secure computation without revealing individual inputs
  - Used for distributed key generation and management
